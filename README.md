An Unofficial GoLang API For Sony Bravia Professional Displays

This library is unaffiliated with Sony, not supported by Sony, and not endorsed by Sony.

Please see the [LICENSE file](LICENSE). 

It implements the Simple IP control protocol, as publicly documented [here](https://pro-bravia.sony.net/develop/integrate/ssip/overview/index.html).

Due to the current pandemic, I do not have access to an _actual_ display to test this with.
